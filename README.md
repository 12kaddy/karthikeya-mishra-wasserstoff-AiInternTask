 AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis This project implements a comprehensive AI pipeline that processes an input image to segment, identify, and analyze objects within the image. The pipeline performs a series of tasks, including image segmentation, object extraction, identification, text/data extraction, attribute summarization, and data mapping. The final output includes a visual representation of the processed image with annotations and a summary table of the mapped data.  Project Overview Objective To build an end-to-end AI pipeline using deep learning and transformer-based models for segmenting, identifying, and analyzing objects in images. The project integrates various models and tools to achieve the following:  Image Segmentation: Segment all objects within an input image. Object Extraction and Storage: Extract and store segmented objects with unique IDs. Object Identification: Identify and describe each object in the segmented images. Text/Data Extraction: Extract any text or relevant data from each object. Summarize Object Attributes: Summarize the nature and attributes of each object. Data Mapping: Map the extracted data and attributes to each object and the master image. Output Generation: Generate the final output image with annotations and a summary table. Key Features Modular Design: The project is organized into distinct modules for each stage of the pipeline (e.g., segmentation, identification, text extraction). Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly Streamlit application to upload images, visualize segmentation results, and view the final output. Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed setup instructions, usage guidelines, and a README to get started quickly. Test Coverage: Includes unit tests for all major components to ensure the robustness of the pipeline. Flexible and Extensible: The pipeline is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy integration of new models or additional features.

The pipeline will process the image and display the following: Segmented objects with annotations. Detailed information about each object (ID, description, extracted text, attributes). A final output image and a table summarizing all extracted data. Review each step of the pipeline and interact with the output. Testing Run the unit tests to ensure everything works as expected:  bash Copy code python -m unittest discover -s tests Presentation Check out the presentation.pptx file for a summary of the project, including the approach, implementation, results, and challenges.  Future Enhancements Improve model accuracy with custom-trained models. Extend the pipeline to support video input. Add advanced NLP techniques for better attribute summarization.
